# Sewanee Shuttle Tracking System

A comprehensive real-time shuttle tracking system built for the University of the South (Sewanee). The system includes mobile apps for drivers and students, plus a web-based admin dashboard.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

- **Backend**: Supabase (Auth, Postgres + PostGIS, Realtime, Edge Functions)
- **Mobile Apps**: React Native with Expo (driver and student apps)
- **Admin Dashboard**: Next.js web application
- **Maps**: React Native Maps, MapLibre GL

## üì± Features

### Student App
- Live map showing shuttle locations in real-time
- ETA calculations for upcoming stops
- Service alerts and notifications
- Automatic updates via Supabase Realtime

### Driver App
- Background GPS tracking with offline queuing
- Start/stop shift functionality
- Battery and connection status monitoring
- Automatic route snapping and progress calculation

### Admin Dashboard
- Live fleet monitoring and management
- Vehicle status and analytics
- Service alert management
- Route and stop management

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Expo CLI (`npm install -g @expo/cli`)
- Supabase account

### Quick Setup
Run the automated setup script:
```bash
./setup.sh
```

Or follow the manual steps below:

### 1. Supabase Setup

1. Create a new Supabase project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Run the database migration:
   - Go to SQL Editor in your Supabase dashboard
   - Copy and paste the contents of `supabase/migrations/20250905065815_bitter_harbor.sql`
   - Execute the migration
3. Deploy the edge function:
   ```bash
   # Install Supabase CLI first: https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli
   supabase functions deploy ingest
   ```
4. Create an admin user:
   - Sign up through your Supabase Auth UI
   - Note the user UUID from the auth.users table
   - Insert their role: 
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO user_roles (user_id, role) VALUES ('YOUR_USER_UUID_HERE', 'admin');
   ```

### 2. Environment Variables

Copy the example files and add your Supabase credentials:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
cp admin-dashboard/.env.local.example admin-dashboard/.env.local
```

Edit both files with your Supabase project URL and anon key (found in Settings > API):
```env
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key_here
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Mobile app dependencies
npm install

# Admin dashboard dependencies
cd admin-dashboard
npm install
cd ..
```

### 4. Running the Applications

#### Mobile Apps (Expo)
```bash
npm run dev
# This starts the Expo development server
# You can then run on iOS simulator, Android emulator, or physical device
```

#### Admin Dashboard
```bash
cd admin-dashboard
npm run dev
# Available at http://localhost:3001
```

### 5. Testing the System

Run the automated test suite:
```bash
./test-system.sh
```

### 6. Creating Test Users

1. **Admin User**: Already created in step 1.4
2. **Driver User**: 
   - Sign up through Supabase Auth
   - Insert role: `INSERT INTO user_roles (user_id, role) VALUES ('DRIVER_UUID', 'driver');`
   - Insert driver profile: `INSERT INTO drivers (user_id, name, assigned_vehicle) VALUES ('DRIVER_UUID', 'Test Driver', 'VEHICLE_UUID');`
3. **Student User**: 
   - Sign up through Supabase Auth  
   - Role defaults to 'student', no additional setup needed

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

### Core Tables
- `routes` - Bus routes with colors and names
- `shapes` - Route geometries as PostGIS LineStrings
- `stops` - Bus stops with locations and sequences
- `vehicles` - Fleet vehicles with labels and route assignments
- `drivers` - Driver profiles with vehicle assignments
- `vehicle_positions` - GPS ping history (append-only)
- `vehicle_latest` - Current vehicle positions (materialized)
- `alerts` - Service alerts and notifications
- `user_roles` - Role-based access control

### Key Features
- **PostGIS Integration**: Geospatial route snapping and distance calculations
- **Real-time Updates**: Automatic position updates via triggers
- **Row Level Security**: Role-based data access control
- **ETA Calculations**: View-based ETA estimates using distance/speed

## üîê Security

### Authentication
- Supabase Auth with email/password
- JWT-based API authentication
- Role-based access control (admin, driver, student)

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- Drivers can only insert GPS data for their assigned vehicle
- Students can read live vehicle positions
- Admins have full management access

## üöõ Deployment

### Mobile Apps
```bash
# Build for production
expo build

# For app stores
eas build --platform all
```

### Admin Dashboard
```bash
cd admin-dashboard
npm run build

# Deploy to Vercel, Netlify, etc.
```

### Supabase
- Database migrations are version controlled
- Edge functions auto-deploy
- Configure environment variables in Supabase dashboard

## üìä Monitoring

The system includes built-in monitoring for:
- Vehicle connection status
- GPS accuracy and battery levels
- Alert management and delivery
- Driver shift tracking

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Notes
