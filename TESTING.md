cd admin-dashboard && npm run dev

# Terminal 3 - Monitor logs (optional)
tail -f ~/.expo/logs/*.log
```

### Manual Testing URLs
- Mobile app: http://localhost:8081 (or Expo Go app)
- Admin dashboard: http://localhost:3001

### Test Data Queries
```sql
-- Check user roles
SELECT * FROM user_roles;

-- Check vehicle positions
SELECT * FROM vehicle_latest;

-- Check recent GPS pings
SELECT * FROM vehicle_positions 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 10;

-- Check alerts
SELECT * FROM alerts WHERE active = true;
```
